# erasure_hardware_sim
 simulate gate and erasure conversion of fluxonium/fluxonium molecule

## fluxonium 2-q gate TODO
turn on decay
mention Q-CTRL to maxim

## fluxonium leakage detection TODO
The q function rotates in place, related to photon number too small?

## Molecule 2-q gate TODO

TODO: read dual-rail transmon and think about how to do fluxonium molecule cross-resonance gate


## Molecule leakage detection TODO
